#ï»¿ShutYouDown

##Overview
Before I go to sleep I leave my PC ON so that some downloads finish, in the remote past I used GShutdown, and in newer versions I couldn find anything similar, so I made my own python script.

##Objectives.
Shut down Ubuntu PC given a certain amount of time.
Perform a series of tasks before shutting down.
Tasks to perform might have their own timers. 
In the future I would like to perform such tasks immediately but with a remote control.
